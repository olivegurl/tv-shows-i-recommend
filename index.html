              Hi, welcome to my site. I'm glad you could make it. I will be recommending some TV shows for you to watch. Have fun looking around! <a href="https://github.com/cpl-makerlab/simple-website-template">This</a> is where I got the template for the site!

            <h2>Historical Fiction</h2>
            <p> 
              <ol><li>The Crown: this is a great tv show for people who are interested in the royal family. There are 6 seasons, and although the sixth season was the most weak in my opinion, I still think it is a good show for lovers of <i> Downtown Abbey </i>. It follows Queen Elizabeth II as she ascends to the throne after her father's death. It covers many well known events in British history, but also some more obscure ones. Overall, I would recommend this for those whose favorite genre is historical fiction.  </p> </li>
<p> <li> My Lady Jane: a tv show that was recently cancelled, it follows a woman named Jane who is being forced to marry a man she doesn't know, Lord Dudley. Sounds like every other historical fiction tv show, right? Well, she also has to marry him to save her family from destitution, 
she finds out he's hot, and oh, there are magic beings called Ethians who have been hiding in plain sight? A laugh-out-loud romp that was gone too soon. #SaveMyLadyJane </p> </li>
<p> <li> Anne with An E: are we starting to see a trend with the tv shows I like (*cough canceled cough*). Well, this one is great, despite not having an ending (but if you're thinking that, go read the books!). The show follows titular character Anne Shirley as she gets adopted by brother and sister Matthew & Marilla Cuthbert, going to live with them in Avonlea. But oops, they wanted a boy, and Anne is a girl! What follows is a pretty loyal adaptation of the beloved book series, except showrunner Moira Walley-Beckett adds her own flares, which I believe make the show that much better. Without spoilers, there's the exploration of more of Anne's personality and background as an orphan, completely new characters, and so much more. These additions make Avonlea (and PEI and Canada) seem that much more historically accurate. Love love love and will never get over it. </p> </li>
